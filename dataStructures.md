### Print function

 * The field in ` print()` can be left blank to use as a line break when writing into The Console

 * Additionally, the parameter `end` as in `print(x, end=" ")` can be used to have the print statement end with something, like a space. Not sure how this is used since I can just add a space at the end of a print command though. 
 * About the above, if `end=""` is used it can prevent line breaks and let different print commands print in one line.

### Exit

 * `exit()` can be used to exit `while` loops.
