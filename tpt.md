## 5.1 Questions

 * Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing

### Beneficial

1. Development of computing accelerates speeds at which calculations are made, and allows us to do complicated calculations quickly.
2. Computing allows us to be more connected across the world, for information to travel quicker, and spreads globalism. We can remain up to date on current events as they unfold.
3. computing and development of technology opens the door for advancements in many types of scientific fields.

### Harmful

1. Increased reliance on computers opens up vulnerabilities and liabilities that could grind society to a halt if these systems fail, due to m like a solar storm or a cyberattack.
2. Development of computers can lead to people staying indoors more, causing health effects from an imbalance of chemicals released into the body.
3. Computers and online communication can decrease face to face communication, which is an important skill that requires continuous practice.

 * Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?

I don't think computers cause real dopamine issues. Games can provide satisfaction and fun but I haven't experienced anything that's close to addiction. The amount of distractions provided by the devices does impact me quite a bit, productivity-wise however. For example, oftentimes homework only takes a few hours to do, but I end up staying up late because I have been off doing irrelevant things instead of doing homework.

## 5.2 Questions 

 * What do you think of investments being made in protection versus investments being made in technology education? Are digital fears expanding digital divide?

I think investments made in technology education automatically contribute to students' sense of digital safety. Being more knowledgablle and more aware of the internet around them empowers them to protect themselves. More and more investment in protection can only bog down what needs to get done and unnecessary restrictions.

 * How does someone empower themself in a digital world?

Being empowered, a citizen can confidently build upon existing knowledge and use it to its fullest extent. This starts with increasing access to the digital world to begin with, and having a foundational knowledge of the digital world.

 * How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.

Someone that is empowered could help the other by keeping them up to date on optimal methods and useful technologies to what they are doing. More importantly, providing access to technology that is capable of doing what needs to be done, such as making computers at libraries more accessible, etc.

 * Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?

Here I take red tape as intended restrictions imposed on another, and paper as literal use of paper. Paper is a useful resource and is more versatile tool than technology sometimes, when you need to solve complex equations quickly and accurately, or when you need to draw something. An example of red tape is the problem of poverty and such preventing access to technology. Especially for the homeless and formerly incarcerated people, who cannot even get a job to get their lives back on track, this is a serious issue. At Del Norte, though, I am not aware of any of these issues. 

## 5.3 Questions

Watch the video... HP computers are racist
Come up with some thoughts on the video and be ready to discuss them as I call on you. Here are some ideas...
Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional?

 * Not really.

If yes or no, justify you conclusion.

 *  He was criticizing the computer and its company while documenting a problem, however he seems to consider this an embarrassing oversight instead of a deliberate negligence.

How do you think this happened?

 * I think the team that developed this feature used a predominantly lighter skinned sample to train the AI. The contrast due to the dark shade of skin that the African person has may impact the ability of the software to recognize facial features too.

Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude?

 * This is harmful, since a portion of HP customers can't use one of their cutting edge (for the time) features, based on their skin color, which is unfair. Although, this was not intended to be harmful or exclude a certain populace.

Should it be corrected?

 * Since this is a bug in the software it should be corrected. 

What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome?

 * Find a more diverse sample to train the algorithm with.

## 5.4 Questions

CompSci has 150 principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?

 * We could survey all 150 students and ask for their advice on how to do well in APCSP, or just high school in general, and assemble a guide based on all of their opinions and advice. This would be initiated by having a Google Form as an exit ticket in one of our weekly canvas assignments.

What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your final project be better with crowdsourcing?

 * Del Norte crowdsourcing (Like in AP Stats) would provide a more diverse sample size than just those who enjoy computer science, and crowdsourcing would help our final project by testing out features or getting feedback and data.

## 5.5 Questions

When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in GitHub pages.

 * Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal: releases your work to the public domain; anyone can use it without paying royalties 
 * Open Source GPL: the work and all derivative works HAVE to be open source
 * Open Source MIT: the work and all derivative works can be used wherever and can be redistributed freely, but it has to stay closed source.

Make a license for your personal and Team project. Document license you picked and why.

 * We used the Open Source GPL. It was recommended to us and we also don't have anything worth copyrighting on here.

## 5.6 Questions

Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles.

 * Login pages require a username and password

What are your feelings about PII and your exposure?

 * While it is useful to store user information and progress on a webpage, it should not record any information beyond the minimum needed.

Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication.

 * Good passwords are random and long, use a wide variety of letters, symbols and numbers; while bad passwords are common and guessed easily. 

Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption.

 * From what I remember, symmetric encryption uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt data, while in asymmetric encryption different keys are used for encrypting and decrypting.

Provide and example of encryption we used in deployment.

 * 

Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques.

 * I have never been phished, but the most common techniques involve disguising a phishing email as a legitimate email from Amazon or UPS. 

### Finals MCQ 1

 * **Score: 48/50**

 （1）. The number of statements in a program usually has less effect on how long the program takes to run. Thus the answer is B.

 （23）. A public key, as the name suggests, is public and can be accessed by anyone so they can recieve encrypted information on the internet. Instead the answer is A, the browser cookies. These often collect and store lots of personal data about the user, leading to a compromise of privacy.

### Finals MCQ 2

* **Score: 50/50**

### Finals MCQ 3

* **Score 46/50**
* (18) The procedure traverses this list and eventually encounters the positive value 1. At this point, the procedure returns true when it should return false because the list does not contain only positive values. My answer was wrong because it would return true, when its supposed to. 
* (32) 15 would not exceed the 4 bit integer limit
* (41) In public cryptography, a message is encrypted with a recipient’s public key and decrypted with the recipient’s private key
* (35) If the album was purchased and downloaded through a licensed music store, the user will not be in violation of the DMCA.

### Finals MCQ 5

* **Score: 49/50**
* (18) Public key encryption is secure and uses a public key and a private key to encode and decode a message, respectively.
